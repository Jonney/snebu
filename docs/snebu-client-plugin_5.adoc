=== snebu-client-plugin(5) - Defines pre-backup and post-backup scripts to run on a client.


==== Description

Specifying the *--plugin* argument when executing a snebu-client backup operation will cause the specified plugin script to be incorporated into the backup process.  The plugin script defines at least two shell script functions -- -fBpluginpre(), which executes prior to the backup, and pluginpost()\R which executes after the backup has completed.

This allows performing operations such as mounting a file system snapshot prior to a backup and removing the snapshot afterwards, or placing a database in hot backup mode at the beginning of the backup.  In the case of backing up a database, often times the backup will need to be completed in multiple stages -- place the DB in hot backup mode, gather a list of database files, back them up, take the DB out of hot backup mode, gather a list of files containing transaction logs that were created during the backup, and finally backing up those files.

To facilitate these type of backup steps, the *pluginpre* function can save the contents of the file include/exclude variables *INCLUDE*, *EXCLUDE*, and *EXCLUDEMATCH*.  Then set the variable *bkrepeat=1*, along with setting any other housekeeping variables used inside the plugin script.  Once it has completed the last stage, it can then restore the include/exclude variables, let the rest of the backup process continue, and then set *bkrepeat=0* to finish off the backup.

==== Functions and Variables


*pluginpre()*::
Shell script code containing pre-backup procedures.

*pluginpost()*::
Shell script code containing post-backup procedures.

*bkrepeat*::
Set bkrepeat=1 to repeat the backup with modifications to the include/exclude list.  Every time the backup repeats, the backup set is amended with the new file set.

*INCLUDE*::
Shell array containing file include list (see *snebu-client.conf(5)*)

*EXCLUDE*::
Shell array containing file exclude list (see *snebu-client.conf(5)*)

*EXCLUDEMATCH*::
Shell array containing file exclude file pattern list (see *snebu-client.conf(5)*)

==== Examples

The following is a template that can be used when backing up a server containing a database.  In this case, the include/exclude list initially includes files to back up the entire server.  So this script does a hot backup of the database first, then adds to the exclude list the dbf files that were backed up initially, and then backs up the rest of the system.

The Since these functions get called at various times from the snebu-client script, the order of the various code fragments can become a bit confusing.  Pay attention to the "(Step x)" labels for the actual execution order in each fragment.

### Snebu backup plugin template for databases

# Initialize an internal housekeeping variable
# (Step 0)
dbstage=0

# Define the pre-backup script
pluginpre() {
    # Stage 0 => haven't backed up the DB yet
    if [ "${dbstage}" = 0 ]
    then
	# (Step 1)
	# Save the current include/exclude list
	OLD_INCLUDE=( "${INCLUDE[@]}" )
	OLD_EXCLUDE=( "${EXCLUDE[@]}" )
	OLD_EXCLUDEMATCH=( "${EXCLUDEMATCH[@]}" )

	# Zero out exclude list
	EXCLUDE=( )
	EXCLUDEMATCH=( )

	# Set the include list to include database files
	DBF_FILES=( "$(
	    # Function to list database filenames to standard output
	    print_dbf_filenames
	)" )
	INCLUDE=( "${DBF_FILES[@]}" )

	# Place DB in hot backup mode
	begin_db_backup

	# After this, snebu-client-backup takes over and backs up
	# the above set include list.  Then control jumps to
	# pluginpost() with dbstage still set to 0
    elif [ "${dbstage}" = 1 ]
    then
	# (Step 3)
	DBF_LOG_FILES=( "$(
	    # Function to list archived transaction logs
	    print_dbf_log_filenames
	)" )
	INCLUDE=( "${DBF_LOG_FILES[@]}" )

	# Back to the backup with the new include list, then
	# off to pluginpost again with dbstage set to 1
    fi
}

pluginpost() {
    if [ "${dbstage}" = 0 ]
    then
	# (Step 2)
	# Take DB out of hot backup mode
	end_db_backup
	
	# Define the next stage, and repeat the backup
	dbstage=1
	bkrepeat=1

	# Now control jumps back to pluginpre() with dbstage=1
    elif [ "${dbstage}" = 1 ]
    then
	# (Step 4)
	# Restore the original include/exclude list, with the
	# database files added to the exclude list.
	INCLUDE=( "${OLD_INCLUDE[@]}" )
	EXCLUDE=( "${OLD_EXCLUDE[@]}" "${DBF_FILES[@]}" 	"${DBF_LOG_FILES[@]}"
	EXCLUDEMATCH=( "${OLD_EXCLUDEMATCH[@]}" )

	# Define the next stage, and repeat the backup
	dbstage=2
	bkrepeat=1

	# Control jumps back to pluginpre(), however no more pre-
	# processing is needed for stage 2, so the backup begins
	# again with the original client include/exclude (plus the
	# above database files added to the exclude).
    elif [ "${dbstage}" = 2 ]
    then
	# (Step 5)
	# Break the cycle, backup is completed for this host.
	bkrepeat=0
    fi
}

# Also, don't forget to fill in the functions referenced above:

begin_db_backup() {
    ### Steps to place DB in hot backup mode
}

end_db_backup() {
    ### Steps to DB out of hot backup mode
}

print_dbf_filenames() {
    ### Output list of dbf file names
}

print_dbf_log_filenames() {
    ### Output list of archived transaction log file names
}
