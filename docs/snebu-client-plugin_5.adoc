=== snebu-client-plugin(5) - Defines pre-backup and post-backup scripts to run on a client.


==== Description

Specifying the *--plugin* argument when executing a snebu-client backup operation will cause the specified plugin script to be incorporated into the backup process.  The plugin script defines at least two shell script functions -- *pluginpref()*, which executes prior to the backup, and *pluginpostf()* which executes after the backup has completed.  Two associated variables, *pluginpre* and *pluginpost*, contain the names of these two functions (so the functions themselves can be named anything, as long as the variables point to them).

This allows performing operations such as mounting a file system snapshot prior to a backup and removing the snapshot afterwards, or placing a database in hot backup mode at the beginning of the backup.  In the case of backing up a database, often times the backup will need to be completed in multiple stages -- place the DB in hot backup mode, gather a list of database files, back them up, take the DB out of hot backup mode, gather a list of files containing transaction logs that were created during the backup, and finally backing up those files.

To facilitate these type of backup steps, the *pluginpre* function can save the contents of the file include/exclude variables *INCLUDE*, *EXCLUDE*, and *EXCLUDEMATCH*.  Then set the variable *bkrepeat=1*, along with setting any other housekeeping variables used inside the plugin script.  Once it has completed the last stage, it can then restore the include/exclude variables, let the rest of the backup process continue, and then set *bkrepeat=0* to finish off the backup.

Note that the plugin runs on the same host that is running the snebu-client script.  So if you are doing _push_ backups from a client to a server, it will function as expected.  But if you are doing _pull_ based backups (running snebu-client from the backup server), then be sure to have the pre and post functions perform their actions on the target server (referencing the *clientname* and _rmtuser_ variables as appropriate).  Feel free to use the *rpcsh()* function defined in snebu-client (see function definition for brief description and usage).

==== Functions and Variables


*pluginpref()*::
Shell script code containing pre-backup procedures.

*pluginpostf()*::
Shell script code containing post-backup procedures.

*pluginpre*::
Variable containing name of pluginpre function

*pluginpost*::
Variable containing name of pluginpost function

*bkrepeat*::
Set bkrepeat=1 to repeat the backup with modifications to the include/exclude list.  Every time the backup repeats, the backup set is amended with the new file set.

*INCLUDE*::
Shell array containing file include list (see *snebu-client.conf(5)*)

*EXCLUDE*::
Shell array containing file exclude list (see *snebu-client.conf(5)*)

*EXCLUDEMATCH*::
Shell array containing file exclude file pattern list (see *snebu-client.conf(5)*)

==== Examples

The following is a template that can be used when backing up a server containing a database.  In this case, the include/exclude list initially includes files to back up the entire server.  So this script does a hot backup of the database first, then adds to the exclude list the dbf files that were backed up initially, and then backs up the rest of the system.

The Since these functions get called at various times from the snebu-client script, the order of the various code fragments can become a bit confusing.  Pay attention to the "(Step x)" labels for the actual execution order in each fragment.
